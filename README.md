Hey @joyroy0521!

Mona here. I'm done preparing your exercise. Hope you enjoy! üíö

Remember, it's self-paced so feel free to take a break! ‚òïÔ∏è

## Regulatory Dashboard

This repository also includes a simple dashboard that analyses an organisation's
profile (geography, industry, products and suppliers) and lists relevant
regulatory categories and potential risks.

Run it with:

```bash
python regulatory_dashboard.py sample_profile.json
```

Modify `sample_profile.json` with your own data to evaluate different
scenarios.

## PFAS Reporting MVP

The repository now contains a reference implementation of a PFAS reporting
workflow inspired by the business requirements document in this exercise.
It ingests supplier declarations from a CSV file and produces a JSON report
aligned to EPA TSCA ¬ß8(a)(7) field names.

Run it with:

```bash
python pfas_reporting.py sample_suppliers.csv report.json --pfas-dict pfas_list.txt
```

The generated `report.json` summarises supplier responses and lists mapped
declarations ready for further processing or submission.

## PFAS Reporting Frontend

This repository includes a minimal Flask web interface for generating reports from the browser.

Run it with:

```bash
python -m pip install flask
python pfas_frontend.py
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5000> and upload the supplier CSV and optional PFAS dictionary to receive the JSON report.
