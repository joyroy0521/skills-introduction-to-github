## Regulatory Dashboard

This repository also includes a simple dashboard that analyses an organisation's
profile (geography, industry, products and suppliers) and lists relevant
regulatory categories and potential risks.

Run it with:

```bash
python regulatory_dashboard.py sample_profile.json
```

Modify `sample_profile.json` with your own data to evaluate different
scenarios.
